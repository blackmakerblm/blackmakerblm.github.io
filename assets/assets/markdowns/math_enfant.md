## INTRODUCTION

In today’s day machines are very present in our everydaylife, we use machines everywhere to face our daily need. We are living in an area of advanced technology where everything is related to science of craft in one way or another and there’s no doubt that over years technology has been responsible for creating amazingly useful resources. But those technologies had to be adapted to our human abilities so that we can use them without any kind of difficulty. So engineers are called to think about Human Machine Interface concept during their design process.


## HUMAN MACHINE INTERFACE

### What is Human Machine Interface?

Human machine interface or HMI for short is a setof means and component of certain devices that are capable of handling human machine interactions. The interface consists of hardware and software that allow user Inputs to be translated as signals for machines that, in turn, provide the required result to the user. The human machine interface technology has been used in different industries like electronics, entertainment, military, medical etc.

## PROJECT FRAMEWORK

The project is about developing a solution that allows five (5) years old kids to learn how to count and how to make basic operations like addition and subtraction.

This kind of project can seem easy but require serious reflection to be able to
develop something that the potential users can use instinctively i.e 5 years old
kids given their limited capacity of understanding. So after observing different
kids I noticed that children are very interested and have lot of fun in playing
games. It’s in that perspective that I decided to make a mobile application
based on game strategy to make my solution.

## HUMAN LEARNING PROCESS

Human learning can be seen as a complex process ofacquiring knowledge it can be illustrated with the following image: We can see the first step is the representation of the information, the
perception and so on as mentioned in the image. In our case the representation of the information must be the simplest as possible so that that any 5 years old kid can have a good perception of it and save it.

## APPLICATION OVERVIEW

As mentioned above the mobile must allow 5 yearsto count and make basic operations. So the application HMI should be very simple.

### Application process

When the user clicks on the application icon the first screen presented to him, gives 3 choices: The first button (jouer) redirect him to the count screen The second button (aide) redirect him to the help page where he can read and understand the different functionalities of the application The third button (quitter) exits the application in other word close the application.

## DEVELOPMENT TOOLS AND LANGUAGE

### Language

Every mobile application for its development we needto choose a programming language that can implement all the functionalities of the mobile application. The choice of the language is also up to the target Operating System (Android, IOS, Blackberry etc.).

I decided to go with DART language for many reasons:

```
● Dart is used to build mobile app, desktop application, backend and web application
● Dart is multiple platform
● Flutter Framework is based on Dart
● Flutter and Dart all stand front of a huge community of developers all over the world
```
### Dart

Dart is a web programming language was created in 2010 by Lars Bak and Kasper Lund 2 computer engineers at Google and developed by Google. The first version was released in 2013. Dart is presented as an alternative to JavaScript and as said by Google it can solve some problems that web developers are facing with other languages.

### Flutter

Flutter is a free, open-source mobile framework thatcan be used to create native Android and IOS apps from a single code base. Flutter is based on Dart language and was also created by Google in 2015 to make mobile application development easy in a way.

### Development tool

The development tool is the environment where thedeveloper implement his solution. Sometimes called Integrated Development Environment or IDE for short is a software that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. It’s composed of source code editor, build automation tools, sometime a debugger and also a compiler or interpreter. I used for this project Android Studio which is an IDE for mobile app development and it’s based on Intellij IDEA open-source.

## ISSUES

The main issue I faced during this project was tofigure out how to play sound in my application. But I solved that by using a flutter plugin which works with android,ios,linux,windows and even web platform

## HOW TO PLAY

When booting the application, the user will see thefirst which will give one a choice between three pages: Jouer, Aide and Quitter. The first Jouer stands for play in french, the second choice is the help page which explains to the user the rules of the game and lastly the exit button. In the Jouer page, the user will have two types of games, the first is mental computing as show in the below image, there is a simple addition of two digits and the user has to choose the answer between two potential results in two moving circle from left to right and right to left, if the result is correct the user will hear a sound and the score displayed in the top right corner will increment by 3 points else the user will hear a buzz sound and the score will decrease by 3 points. Down screen there is a tabview where the user can go to the next game which is simply selecting between 4 numbers displayed in a grid of 2 rows and 2 columns from the smallest to the greatest. For each correct answer the grid of the concerned digit will turn in green color and red color for false answer.

## CONCLUSION

In conclusion I can say that this project has beena great opportunity for me to practice all I learned in class in HMI course and also to improve my knowledge in flutter technology and to understand how most mobile application works behind. I wish to keep developing great application for different need of the society, I believe that many problem of the society especially Africa can be solved by digital technologies and I really want to take part of this revolution by developing good solutions that can face the real problem of my country and the continent.
